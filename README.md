## Personal Details
I am a student at Wake Tech studying under the Network Managment program. I do have some minor programming experience, mainly with Python as it was needed for my ventures into network automation.

## Websites I Recommend
    - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - I use Youtube ALOT. It serves as both enertainment and education for me. It was even the primary learning resource for when I was getting my CCNA. 
    - [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) - I also use Spotify alot. Having the background noise really helps me focus on both schoolwork and work work.
